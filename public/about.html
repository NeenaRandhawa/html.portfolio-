<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hi, I'm Neena. I'm a BCA student, and I'm really passionate about computers. When I'm not studying, you can find me listening to music or trying out new recipes in the kitchen. Music and cooking are my favorite hobbies - they help me relax and express myself.</p>

<p>I'm currently pursuing my graduation in BCA, and I'm loving every minute of it. Computer science is my favorite subject, and I enjoy learning about new technologies and innovations. I'm excited to see where my degree takes me, and I'm looking forward to a career in tech.</p>
